### HikePoster
Hike poster is a web app that allows users to create and share posts of their favorite hikes. Users can create a post by uploading a photo, adding a title, and adding a description. Users can also view posts created by other users and from there find the exact GPS locatioon where the photo was uploaded (Idea is post is posted where the photgraph was taken on the hike).

By clicking the "Get Location" button, the user will be redirected to a map where they can see the exact location of the post. This will also send a Google Maps API call as a reporting system for admins to understand which places their users are hiking at and whihc hikes/posts interest them the most. Data organization is to be implemented in the future and currently admins can only see what API calls are being used and what their parameters are.
